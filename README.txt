REQUIREMENTS
------------


INSTALLATION
------------

Before installing Islandora the XACML policies located in the policies folder
should be copied into the Fedora global XACML policies folder. This will allow
"authenticated users" in Drupal to access Fedora API-M functions.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The islandora_drupal_filter passes the username of 'anonymous' through to 
Fedora for unauthenticated Drupal Users.  A user with the name of 'anonymous'
may have XACML policies applied to them that are meant to be applied to Drupal
users that are not logged in or vice-versa.  This is a potential security issue
that can be plugged by creating a user named 'anonymous' and restricting access
to the account.

Drupal's cron will can be ran to remove expired authentication tokens.
